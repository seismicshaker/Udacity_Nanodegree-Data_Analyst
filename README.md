## Project 1: Investigate a Dataset
### Introduction to Data Analysis

The aim of this project is to examine a dataset containing more than 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil to determine what factors may contribute to a patient missing their appointments. I utilize the Pandas library for analysis and visualization of the dataset.

## Project 2: A/B Test Results
### Practical Statistics

In this project, I analyze A/B test results for a fictional e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Project 3: WeRateDogs Data Wrangling
### Data Wrangling

In this project, I demonstrate the data wrangling processes in fetching CSV, TSV, and JSON files. Further, I identify and fix several data quaility and tidiness issues.

## Project 4: 
### Data Visualization

This project is a visual analysis of the Prosper Loan dataset. The data includes more than 100k loans recorded with 81 columns describing both loan and borrower information. I am interested in what factors may affect a Borrower's APR.
