# Prosper Loan Data
## by Adam Arce


## Dataset

> This report is a visual analysis of the Prosper Loan dataset. The data includes more than 100k loans recorded with 81 columns describing both loan and borrower information. I am interested in what factors may affect **BorrowerAPR**. 


## Summary of Findings

> In the univariate, we found that BorrowerAPR exhibited a right-skewed distribution with a mode forming a secondary peak at 0.35797. Bivariate exploration found that BorrowerAPR forms a negative correlation with all other quantitative data. And in the multivariate exploration, we were able to look a high-rate subset that all had OriginalLoanAmount ranging $2000-4000. Addition, we observed that unverified income and certain employment statuses were associated with high rates.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The goal of the presentation is present the most compelling figures that support my observation that BorrowerAPR is negatively correlated with CreditScore, AvailableBankcardCredit, and OriginalLoanAmount. Additionally, high-rates are associated with $2000-4000 loans or being unemployed.
